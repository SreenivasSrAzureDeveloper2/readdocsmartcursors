========================================

We caters to a wide range of business needs. I.e. *Single Page Apps (SPA)* , customized website modules, 
Responsive designs, CRM integrations and even complete stand-alone web-based applications. When itâ€™s time
for development to actually start, we assign specialists that match :ref:`extensive <Option>` with the technologies selected during 
the architecture phase. Our **agile-based development** runs in three-week sprints that result in a new, incremental
build at the end of each sprint, allowing you to regularly `My coding <https://mycodin.blogspot.in/>`_.
  
Incremental quality assurance analysis means that there are no surprises at the end. And once the app is 
ready for the public, we host it to cloud and your :doc:`/Option/justlogic` website goes live. Our team does everything from making 
sure your desired web app is available :doc:`online </Option/justlogic>`
